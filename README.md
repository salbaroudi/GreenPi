## TerraPi: A Multi-Sensor, Multi-Relay Terrararium Project:

### Introduction:

This project integrates various sensors and relays to produce a monitoring platform for a Terrararium.

### Precursors and Sources:

The original code base for this project was sourced from RasPiVivarium, a defunct Raspberry Pi sensor/relay project. This code based utilized python, php, javascript, mysql and was served on apache2; a standard LAMP project with a basic user interface.

The basic ideas for sensors and relays have been greatly expanded, and the code base heavily modified for this project.
